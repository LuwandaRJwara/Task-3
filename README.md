Password Strength Assessment Tool

This is a simple Password Strength Assessment Tool designed to evaluate the strength of a password based on several common criteria such as length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
The tool provides feedback to the user on how strong or weak their password is, and suggests improvements to enhance its security.

Features
Password Strength Assessment: Evaluates the strength of a given password based on various criteria.
Feedback: Provides feedback on password strength (e.g., weak, moderate, strong) and suggests improvements.

Criteria Used:
  Password length
  Presence of uppercase and lowercase letters
  Presence of numbers
  Presence of special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, etc.)

Technologies Used
  Python: The main programming language used for the tool.
  Regular Expressions (Regex): Used to validate and check the presence of specific character types in the password (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).

How It Works
  Length Check: The tool checks whether the password meets a minimum length requirement (e.g., 8 characters).
  Uppercase & Lowercase Letters: The tool ensures that the password contains both uppercase and lowercase letters.
  Numbers: The tool checks that the password contains at least one numeric character (0-9).
  Special Characters: The tool ensures that the password includes at least one special character, such as !, @, #, $, etc.
  Strength Rating: Based on the evaluation of the above criteria, the tool provides a strength rating (e.g., Weak, Moderate, Strong) and recommends improvements to enhance the   password's security.
